Drone and ground communication - follow LoRawan --> need to research to update the protocol

drone logic
----------
from ground - 
listen for orders
decrypt
data structure is an array of bytes - update the counts
some kind of timeout before you stop listening

to hospital - 
connect and key exchange
send all orders
send end packet that says that orders are all sent (when orders left == 0)



ground logic
----------
power on -> if order is 0, not in connecting maxOrders
when order is put in from the cli, it starts trying to connect to a drone
*it should be clear that order is here, hasnt been sent to drone*
just turn off listening/sending after


CLI
---------
*double check if python has serial output so we can send*
end interface for users - csv and python
interface rn for debugging - just use python cli 
individual order building, csv

when order is made, send order via serial in the processed packet format
