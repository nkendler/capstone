key - diffie-hellman

1. 
Sender and Receiver publicly agree to use a module p = 23 and base g = 5

2.
Sender and Receiver each choose a secret integer (s for sender, r for receiver)

3.
Sender chooses s = 4 and sends receiver S = (g^s) mod p = (5^4) mod 23 = 4
Receiver chooses r = 3 and sends sender R = (g^r) mod p = (5^3) mod 23 = 10

4. 
Sender computes shared key k = (R^s) mod p = (10^4) mod 23 = 18
Receiver computes shared key k = (S^r) mod p = (4 ^ 3) mod 23 = 18
